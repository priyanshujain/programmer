## Form

I think about Forms more as validators of the input that my user is adding on my application.

Validations such as the formatting the date field, make sure an integer number is bigger than zero, and require all fields to be filled up, live in the Form. It doesn't care if the username you're trying to add already exists. It is not the Form's responsibility to know about business logic.
