## Template: 

The template is there to define the markup that will be processed by the view. The template system that Django uses is sophisticated and allow extensions and few logical operations. 

Due to the high-level of customization that is possible here, it is very easy to add a lot of business logic to that. Avoid it! Leave your template with the responsibility of dealing only with the presentation aspect of your application.
