Issue triage is essential. Keeping a low number of un-triaged issues is a collective responsibility. Any team member can triage an issue. The Github labels, projects and milestones are used to indicate the current state of the issue and whether it is triaged or not.


## Using labels

Each issue should have three labels 

1. Priority label
2. Type label
3. Status label

### Priority labels

1. `Critical`: This issue requires an immediate attention and it should not be left unassigned. This can be a production bug or an immediate priority feature.

2. `High`: This issue is something that's a top priority and part of the current/immediate next roadmap.

3. `Medium`: This issue is something that's not a top priority and part of the current/immediate next roadmap.

4. `Low`: This issue is something that's not a priority and kept for a future build.


### Type labels

1. `Bug`
2. `Enhancement`
3. `Feature`
4. `Future Build`
5. `Help Needed`
6. `Idea`
7. `Question`


### Status labels

1. `Review Needed`
2. `Confirmed`
3. `In Progress`
4. `On Hold`
5. `Temporary Fix`
6. `Feedback Needed`
7. `Complete`
8. `Archived`




## Use projects to identify the features

High-level features can be added as a project in the Github repository. To track and monitor the request coming in a particular feature, add a project in each issue. E.g., Facebook Inbox is a high-level feature. Any request for Facebook Inbox changes can be marked as an issue in the project "Facebook Inbox".

// TODO: Decide the criteria for projects

## Use milestones to complete the triage

An issue triage is complete when it has a milestone assigned to it. In most cases, we would have issues that have labels, severity and project assigned to it. Adding milestones is the last step and indicates the prioritization of the issue.


## Use Github discussion for questions

If there is a question about the project, create an issue with the label `question`.
